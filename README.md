# Counter App (using GetX)

This project is a simple **Counter App** built using Flutter. It is designed for study purposes and showcases the use of **GetX** for state management. Additionally, it supports responsive design and demonstrates the integration of multiple Flutter dependencies.

## Features

- **Responsive UI:** Built to adjust seamlessly to various screen sizes using `flutter_screenutil`.
- **State Management:** Managed using **GetX**, ensuring a clean and efficient architecture.
- **Modern Fonts:** Styled with Google Fonts for a visually appealing look.
- **Persistent Data:** Includes `shared_preferences` to save and retrieve data locally.
- **HTTP Integration:** Demonstrates the use of the `http` package for API interactions.
- **Extendable:** Built to allow easy addition of future features like attaching more data and creating beautiful counters dynamically.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/counter-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd counter-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Project Structure

The app follows a clean architecture approach:

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ counter_controller.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ views/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home_view.dart
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ counter_view.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ constants.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart
```

- **`controllers/`**: Contains GetX controllers for state management.
- **`views/`**: Includes all the UI components of the app.
- **`utils/`**: Holds reusable utilities like constants or helper functions.

## UI Preview

The app UI is simple yet modern, leveraging the power of `flutter_screenutil` for responsiveness and `google_fonts` for styling. It serves as a base for further enhancements like dynamic data-driven counters.
